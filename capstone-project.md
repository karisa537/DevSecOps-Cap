# DevSecOps Capstone Project: Secure CI/CD Pipeline with GitOps

## Introduction

This capstone project demonstrates a complete DevSecOps workflow for building, securing, deploying, and monitoring a containerized application. The project integrates version control, containerization, infrastructure as code (IaC), orchestration, monitoring, and security scanning tools to ensure secure and automated delivery.

The application can be a simple web app (e.g., a Node.js or Python app) hosted in a Kubernetes cluster. The focus is on implementing DevSecOps best practices, including automated security checks, GitOps for declarative deployments, and observability.

Key technologies:
- **Git**: Version control system for code repository.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning (e.g., Kubernetes cluster setup).
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Orchestration platform for hosting the application.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps tool for continuous deployment to Kubernetes.
- **SonarQube**: Static code analysis for code quality and security vulnerabilities.
- **Trivy**: Container image scanning for vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline orchestration.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization of application and infrastructure metrics.

The workflow emphasizes "shift-left" security by integrating scans early in the pipeline, automated deployments via GitOps, and real-time monitoring.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is a high-level architecture diagram represented using Mermaid syntax for easy rendering in Markdown viewers (e.g., GitHub, VS Code). It illustrates the end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline flow.

### Diagram Explanation
- **Left Side (CI)**: Starts with code commit, runs security scans (SonarQube for code, Trivy for images), builds and pushes Docker images.
- **Middle (Infrastructure)**: Terraform provisions the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Right Side (CD/GitOps)**: ArgoCD pulls manifests from Git and deploys to K8s.
- **Bottom (Monitoring)**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from the cluster/app, visualized in Grafana.
- Arrows show the automated flow, with security integrated at multiple stages.

## Project Components and Setup

### 1. Version Control (Git)
- Use Git for managing application code, infrastructure code (Terraform), and Kubernetes manifests.
- Repository Structure:
  - `app/`: Application source code.
  - `infra/`: Terraform scripts for K8s cluster.
  - `manifests/`: Kubernetes YAML files for deployments (managed by ArgoCD).
- Host on GitHub for integration with GitHub Actions.

### 2. Containerization (Docker)
- Dockerfile in the app directory to build the application image.
- Example: For a simple Node.js app, the Dockerfile might include multi-stage builds for security (e.g., using slim base images).

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Provision a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., on AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Minikube for local dev).
- Modules for networking, security groups, and cluster configuration.
- Ensure idempotency and version control of IaC.

### 4. Orchestration (Kubernetes Cluster)
- Host the application as Deployment, Service, and Ingress.
- Use namespaces for isolation (e.g., dev, prod).
- Enable autoscaling and resource limits for security/best practices.

### 5. GitOps (ArgoCD)
- Install ArgoCD in the K8s cluster.
- Configure ArgoCD to watch the `manifests/` repo branch.
- Any changes to manifests trigger automatic sync/deploy to K8s.
- Enables declarative, auditable deployments.

### 6. Security Scanning
- **SonarQube**: Integrated in CI to scan code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. Fail builds on critical issues.
- **Trivy**: Scan Docker images post-build for OS/package vulnerabilities. Generate reports and block pushes if high-severity issues found.

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Workflow YAML files in `.github/workflows/`.
- Stages:
  1. Lint/Test code.
  2. SonarQube scan.
  3. Build Docker image.
  4. Trivy scan.
  5. Push image to registry.
  6. Update manifests in GitOps repo (e.g., bump image tag).
- Use secrets for API keys/tokens.
- Parallel jobs for efficiency.

### 8. Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)
- Deploy Prometheus in K8s to scrape metrics from nodes, pods, and app (e.g., via /metrics endpoint).
- Grafana for dashboards: CPU/memory usage, app health, alert on anomalies.
- Integrate alerts (e.g., via Slack/Email).

## Workflow Overview

1. Developer commits code to Git.
2. GitHub Actions triggers CI: Tests, SonarQube scan → Build Docker → Trivy scan → Push image.
3. If successful, update K8s manifests in Git (e.g., new image tag).
4. ArgoCD detects change, deploys to K8s cluster (provisioned by Terraform).
5. Prometheus monitors the running app; Grafana visualizes.
6. Security is baked in: Scans fail the pipeline if issues detected.

## Expected Deliverables

- **Repositories**:
  - Main app repo with code, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflows.
  - Separate IaC repo for Terraform.
  - GitOps repo for K8s manifests.

- **Documentation**:
  - README.md in each repo explaining setup, commands, and architecture.
  - This .md file as the project overview.

- **Pipeline Artifacts**:
  - SonarQube reports (screenshots or links).
  - Trivy scan results (JSON/SARIF files).
  - Deployed app URL (e.g., via Ingress).

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Terraform state files and provisioned K8s cluster (destroyable for cleanup).
  - ArgoCD dashboard access/screenshots.

- **Monitoring Setup**:
  - Grafana dashboards exported as JSON.
  - Sample alerts configured.

- **Demo/Proof**:
  - Video or screenshots showing end-to-end: Commit → Pipeline → Deployment → Monitoring.
  - Security fix demo: Introduce vuln, show pipeline fail, fix, and redeploy.

- **Report**:
  - Lessons learned, challenges (e.g., integrating tools), and DevSecOps benefits (e.g., reduced MTTR, improved security posture).

This project showcases a robust DevSecOps implementation, ready for extension (e.g., adding secrets management with Vault or of github secretes manager component.
